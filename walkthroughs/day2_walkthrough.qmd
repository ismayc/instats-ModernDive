# Day 2: Linear Regression in R

## Session 4: Simple Linear Regression Analysis

### 1. Load Necessary Packages

```{r}
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
```

- These packages provide tools for data wrangling, visualization, and modeling.  

---

### 2. Prepare Dataset

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)

# Only use complete rows of data

```

- We'll be exploring the `penguins` data frame from the `palmerpenguins` package as well. It contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. More information is [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html).  
- We remove rows with missing values.
