# Day 4: Hypothesis Testing and Inference for Regression in R

## Session 10: One and Two-Sample Hypothesis Testing

### 1. Load Necessary Packages

```{r}
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
library(infer)

# We'll again use `palmerspenguins` for data in this session
library(palmerpenguins)

# We'll use GGally when creating a scatterplot matrix later in Session 11
# install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
```

- These packages provide tools for data wrangling, visualization, modeling, and inference.  
- The `infer` package is particularly useful for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

### 3. One Sample Mean Problem: Simulation-Based Approach with Bootstrapping

We have recently discovered that the food sources for the penguins near Palmer Station has changed over the last year. There is some evidence that the penguins have more food available to them. Previously the penguins had an average body mass of 4100 grams. Suppose we want to test the claim that the average body mass of penguins is
different than this hypothesized value of 4100 grams. We have a sample of 333 penguins from the `penguins` dataset after removing values.

```{r}
# Prepare the data
penguins_data <- penguins |> 
  na.omit()

# Set hypothesized value for use throughout


# Set significance level


# Calculate the observed test statistic (from our sample data)


# Can also be done by skipping over the `generate()` step

```

```{r}

# Walk through the infer steps

```

```{r}
# Visualize the null distribution and p-value

```

```{r}
# Retrieve the p-value

```

#### Interpret the results of the test


---

### 4. One Sample Mean Problem: Traditional Approach with t-test

We can also use the traditional approach to test the same hypothesis using a $t$-test with `infer`. 

```{r}
# Conduct the t-test


# Construct the theoretical null distribution


# Visualize the null distribution and p-value


# Find the theoretical p-value

```

The interpretation is the same as for the simulation-based test with bootstrapping.

**Bonus**: This can also be done directly in R, with much less code overall, but not all tests work like this and without a common framework it can get confusing in my opinion.

```{r}
# Conduct the t-test directly in R

```

---

### 5. Two Sample Mean Problem: Simulation-Based Approach with a Permutation Test

We now want to test the claim that the average body mass of Adelie penguins is statistically discernibly different than the average body mass of Chinstrap penguins.

H_0: $\mu_{\text{Adelie}} = \mu_{\text{Chinstrap}}$
H_A: $\mu_{\text{Adelie}} \ne \mu_{\text{Chinstrap}}$

OR

H_0: $\mu_{\text{Adelie}} - \mu_{\text{Chinstrap}} = 0$
H_A: $\mu_{\text{Adelie}} - \mu_{\text{Chinstrap}} \ne 0$

```{r}
# Set significance level


# Prepare the data


# Calculate the observed test statistic (from our sample data)

```

```{r}
# Do some data visualization

```


```{r}
# Walk through the infer steps

```

```{r}
# Visualize the null distribution and p-value

```

```{r}
# Retrieve the p-value

```

Check out `?get_p_value` to see the options for `direction`.

#### Interpret the results of the test



---

### 6. Two Sample Mean Problem: Traditional Approach with t-test

We can also use the traditional approach to test the same hypothesis using a $t$-test with `infer`.

```{r}
# Conduct the t-test


# Construct the theoretical null distribution


# Visualize the null distribution and p-value


# Find the theoretical p-value

```

**Bonus**: This can also be done directly in R, but requires us to change the
format of the data a little bit. We have a `t_test()` function in `infer` that
wraps the data, so we don't have to do this extra step.

```{r}
# Conduct the t-test directly

```


### 7. Comparing to Confidence Intervals: Checking for the 0 Value

We can also check if the 0 value is in the confidence interval for the difference in means. If it is, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the $\alpha$ level of significance. In order for this to work, $\alpha$ should be 100% - the confidence level.

```{r}
# Calculate the confidence interval


```

## Session 11: Inference for Regression

### 8. Recall One of Our Previous Multiple Linear Regression Models

```{r}
# Fit a multiple regression model without interaction terms

# Get regression coefficients

```

---

### 9. Visualize the Relationship Between Predictors and Response

```{r}
# Focus on only the columns of interest

# Plot a matrix to view the relationships between variables

```

---

### 10. Theory-Based Hypothesis Testing for Regression Coefficients

We can perform hypothesis tests to determine if the regression (partial slope) coefficients are significantly different from zero using the `moderndive` package.

```{r}
# Conduct hypothesis tests for regression coefficients

```

Review [Section 10.5 of ModernDive Second Edition](https://moderndive.com/v2/inference-for-regression.html#theory-multiple-regression) for more details on the theory behind hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for regression coefficients.

### 11. Check Model Fit and Diagnostics

```{r}
# Get fitted values and residuals

```

```{r}
# Visualize the fitted values and the residuals


# Visualize the residuals using a QQ plot

```

More details on checking model fit and model assumptions can be found in [Subsection 10.2.6 of ModernDive Second Edition](https://moderndive.com/v2/inference-for-regression.html#model-fit).

---

### 12. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for Regression Coefficients

We can also use simulation-based inference to test the significance of the regression coefficients. Here, we will use bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals for the partial slope coefficients. Bootstrapping now bootstraps the entire row of data, instead of just a single variable

```{r}
# Get the observed model fit


# Bootstrap distribution for the partial slope coefficients


# Then fit a linear regression model to each replicate of data


# Visualize the bootstrap distribution for the partial slope coefficients


# Get the confidence intervals for the partial slope coefficients

```

### 13. Hypothesis Tests for Regression Coefficients using Permutation Tests

```{r}
# Generate the null distributions for each of the regression coefficients

# Visualize and shade the p-value for each regressor

# Get the p-values

```

### Session 11 Review Questions

**`(11.1)`** What is the null hypothesis when performing a hypothesis test on a regression coefficient in a multiple regression model?

A. The coefficient is significantly different from zero.  
B. The coefficient is equal to the observed mean.  
C. The coefficient is equal to zero, indicating no effect of the predictor on the response variable.  
D. The coefficient is greater than zero, indicating a positive effect of the predictor on the response variable.

---

**`(11.2)`** When interpreting the p-value for a regression coefficient, what does a small $p$-value (e.g., < 0.05) indicate?

D. The residuals are not normally distributed.

---

---

**`(11.4)`** Why is it important to check the residuals of a multiple regression model using diagnostic plots like the residual plot and the QQ plot?

A. To ensure that the response variable is correctly predicted by the model.  
B. To verify that the assumptions of linearity, normality, and constant variance are not violated.  
C. To determine the p-value for each coefficient in the model.

## Session 12: Storytelling with Data

![](https://moderndive.com/v2/images/flowcharts/flowchart/flowchart.002.png)

### 14. Let's Load the `tidyverse`

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

There are more packages in the tidyverse that we don't cover much in the book, but
I've found incredibly useful for data wrangling:

- `forcats` for working with factors
- `stringr` for working with strings
- `purrr` for working with functions

```{r}
# This is the same as running each of these individually
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
```

There are even more packages loaded than this though. Check out the full list
on [the tidyverse page](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

The `infer` package is part of the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/) 
collection of packages that are designed to work well with the tidyverse 
for modeling and inference too.

There's so much more we could cover in this course. Check out [Chapter 11 of
ModernDive Second Edition](https://moderndive.com/v2/thinking-with-data.html) 
for an overview as well. I hope you've gotten a good amount of tools and theory 
to help you get started with data analysis and statistics in R
using the `tidyverse`, `moderndive`, and `infer` to wrangle, visualize, model, 
and infer from your data. Go tell your story with data!
