# Day 3: Sampling and Estimation in R

## Session 1: Sampling

### 1. Load Necessary Packages

```{r}
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
library(infer)
```

- These packages provide tools for data wrangling, visualization, and modeling.  

---

### 2. Prepare Population Dataset with Generation

```{r}
# For reproducibility
set.seed(2024)

# Create vectors of sport ball types and their proportions
types_of_sport_balls <- c("Basketball", "Pickleball", "Tennis Ball", 
                          "Football/Soccer", "American Football")
proportion_of_each_type <- c(0.2, 0.15, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1)

# Create a tibble of 1200 sport balls that will act as our population
store_ball_inventory <- tibble(
  ball_ID = 1:1200,
  ball_type = sample(x = types_of_sport_balls,
                     size = 1200, 
                     replace = TRUE, 
                     prob = proportion_of_each_type
  )
)
```

- We'll be exploring a synthesized data set of an inventory at a large sporting goods store. The inventory pertains to different types of sports balls, 1200 in total.

### 3. Exploring Dataset Structure

```{r}
# Use glimpse to explore the structure of the dataset
glimpse(store_ball_inventory)
```


---

### 4. Population Parameters

```{r}
# Create a count of ball_type
store_ball_inventory |> 
  count(ball_type)

# Determine the proportion of pickleballs in the inventory
p_df <- store_ball_inventory |> 
  summarize(prop_pickle = mean(ball_type == "Pickleball"))

# Convert p to a numeric value
p <- p_df$prop_pickle

# Or using the tidyverse
p <- p_df |> pull(prop_pickle)
```


---

### 5. Take a Sample of Balls

```{r}
# Retrieve a sample of 50 balls from the inventory
ball_sample <- store_ball_inventory |> 
  slice_sample(n = 50, replace = FALSE)

# Determine the proportion of pickleballs in the sample
ball_sample |> 
  summarize(prop_pickle = mean(ball_type == "Pickleball"))
```

---

### 6. Take Another Sample of Balls

```{r}
# Retrieve another sample of 50 balls from the inventory
ball_sample2 <- store_ball_inventory |> 
  slice_sample(n = 50, replace = FALSE)

# Determine the proportion of pickleballs in the sample
ball_sample2 |> 
  summarize(prop_pickle = mean(ball_type == "Pickleball"))
```


---

### 7. Take 1000 Samples of Size 50 from the Population

```{r}
# Use `rep_slice_sample()` from the `infer` package
ball_samples <- store_ball_inventory |> 
  rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000, replace = FALSE)
```


---

### 8. Calculate Sample Proportions and Visualize Them

```{r}
# Determine sample proportions with `dplyr`
props_pickle <- ball_samples |> 
  summarize(prop_pickle = mean(ball_type == "Pickleball"))

# Create a histogram of the sample proportions
ggplot(props_pickle, aes(x = prop_pickle)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion", title = "Histogram of 1000 sample proportions of Pickleballs") 

```


---

### 9. Determine a Guess at the Standard Error

```{r}
# Using the simulations, calculate the standard deviation of the 
# sample proportions
se_sample_props <- props_pickle |> 
  summarize(sd(prop_pickle)) |> 
  pull()

# Using the formula for the standard error of a sample proportion
n <- 50
se_sample_props_formula <- sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
```
