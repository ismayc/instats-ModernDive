# Day 3: Sampling and Estimation in R

## Session 7: Sampling

### 1. Load Necessary Packages

```{r}
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
library(infer)
```

- These packages provide tools for data wrangling, visualization, modeling, and inference.  

---

### 2. Prepare Population Dataset with Generation

```{r}
# For reproducibility
set.seed(2024)

# Create vectors of sport ball types and their proportions
types_of_sport_balls <- c("Basketball", "Pickleball", "Tennis Ball", 
                          "Football/Soccer", "American Football")
proportion_of_each_type <- c(0.2, 0.15, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1)

# Create a tibble of 1200 sport balls that will act as our population
store_ball_inventory <- tibble(
  ball_ID = 1:1200,
  ball_type = sample(x = types_of_sport_balls,
                     size = 1200, 
                     replace = TRUE, 
                     prob = proportion_of_each_type
  )
)
```

- We'll be exploring a synthesized data set of an inventory at a large sporting goods store. The inventory pertains to different types of sports balls, 1200 in total.
